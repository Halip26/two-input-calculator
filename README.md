# **Calculator Web Application with Flask**

This is a simple web application built using Flask that functions as a calculator. Users can enter two numbers and choose an operation to perform, and the application will display the calculated result.

## **Requirements**

* Python (version 3.x recommended)
* Flask ([https://flask.palletsprojects.com/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/))

## **Installation**

1. Install Flask using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## **Running the Application**

1. Save the code in a file named `app.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This will start the Flask development server, and the application will be accessible at <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> (by default).

## **Usage**

1. Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> in your web browser.
2. Enter two numbers in the respective fields.
3. Select the desired operation from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Calculate" button.
5. The calculated result will be displayed on the page.

## **Supported Operations**

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Floor Division (//) - Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division
* Modulus (%) - Returns the remainder after division

## **Error Handling**

The application handles division and modulus by zero errors, returning appropriate messages to the user.

## **Explanation of the Code**

The code defines a Flask application named `app`. The `@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])` decorator defines a route handler function for the root URL (`/`). This function handles both GET and POST requests.

The `calculator` function:

1. Initializes a variable `result` to store the calculation outcome.
2. Defines functions for various mathematical operations (`addition`, `subtraction`, etc.).
3. Checks if the request method is `POST`.
4. If it's a POST request, retrieves the two numbers and the chosen operation from the form data.
5. Performs the selected operation based on the `operation` variable and stores the result.
6. Handles division and modulus by zero errors.
7. Uses `render_template` to render the `index.html` template, passing the `result` variable to the template.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures the application is only run directly and not imported as a module. It calls `app.run(debug=True)` to start the development server in debug mode.

## **Template (index.html)**

The `index.html` template would typically contain the HTML structure for the calculator interface, including input fields, a dropdown menu for selecting operations, a submit button, and a section to display the calculated result. You'll need to create this template file to complete the application.

I hope this comprehensive readme.md provides a clear understanding of the calculator application and its usage!
